# This a demo repository for The Odin Project

This repo is just a demo repo as I've decided to work through the Odin Project

## Some history
I've been working with html for many years, but never actually went through any structured course, more or less just "tinkered". I decided I should brush up and learn more in depth and decided to start from scratch with The Odin Project. This repo is my work on that project.

## Demonstrations
The project here is meant to demonstrate the follow principals of HTML5. No CSS is used.

* Links, both relative and absolute.
* Unordered lists
* Ordered Lists
* Organizational Structure (sub directory linking)
* Heading Elements
* And of course a boiler plate

# More on the Odin Project
So far my opinion of The Odin Project is quite well. I find it entertaining enough to keep reading and even though I've been "tinkering" with html for more than a decade, I've already learned something, which is the whole point. Sometimes you just need to go back to basics, to move forward.

I highly recommend you checkout [The Odin Project](https://TheOdinProject)
